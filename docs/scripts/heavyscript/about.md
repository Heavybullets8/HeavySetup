## HeavyScript

HeavyScript is a script created by me, with the idea of being modular, it includes many options and cool features.


### Why This Script?

Some other scripts are derived from this one, a lot of my logic, a lot of my regex etc.

So I do not see the point in using someone elses script when you can get the latest and greatest straight from the source

> However, it would be unfair to say that I came up with this all on my own, I did not, some of the ideas were taken from other projects, I just would like to _think_ I implemented them better, but I guess thats up to you to decide

#### Focuses

- Stability
> Everything is tested first on my Virtual Machine(running nightlies), then tested on my main server, and then finally after a while it is pushed to main, for everyone.

- Modularity
> It is your machine, I wont force you to do any option you might not want to
>> Self script updates are optional, Rolling back applications is optional, etc
