## Purpose

I personally use this to:

- Download Torrent Files
    - Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr all send their Torrent download requests to qBittorrent

Specifically, I use qBittorrent with a Mullvad VPN on my home network, with only public trackers.

For my private trackers I use a seedbox with rTorrent (guide coming soon).

I do not personally believe qBit is the BEST bittorrent client for seedboxes, unless that seedbox can also download qBit manage.
