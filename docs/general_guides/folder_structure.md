# Folder Structure

This guide is purely my opinion and what works and makes things easier for me, if you would like to have a folder called `Media For Plex UltimaTE xx Edition` thats totally up to you.

<br />

## General Guide for Folder Layouts

**_Things to avoid_**

- Spaces in folder names
    - _Otherwise you will have to deal with escaping spaces in file paths and annoying stuff like that_
- Capitalization 
    - _Personal preference, I like to keep all of my files lowercase and uniform_
    - _That wa you don't have to remember whether or not the file or folder **is** lowercase or not its just simply always lowercase_
    - _Linux is `CaSe SeNsIsTiVe` after all, so you HAVE to remember_
- Any sort of special character besides "_" or "-"

## Media Folders

-  Spread out your media folder in a way plex can understand 
    - Such as separating `series`, `movies` and `music`
