# Welcome to Heavy Setup

## Purpose

Provide guides for setting up applications specifically for Truenas SCALE

This site is still under development and has a long way to go at the moment. 

But feel free to search for guides.

<br />

## Inspiration

I know that the Truenas community does not have a ton of beginner friendly guides like other ecosystems do. I wanted to be apart of the community fixing that. So here is my contribution.

Also in the future, I would like the community to submit guides to this site as well, I am hoping to turn this into a nice community hub for Truenas SCALE specific guides. Heres hoping for the best!

## Shout Outs 

This site takes a lot of inspiration from [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info/)

This guide also references a lot of [TrueCharts](https://truecharts.org) guides and applications
